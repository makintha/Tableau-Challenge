# Tableau-Challenge

For this challenge we are tasked to analysed the Citybike Service in NYC.

The data selected for this task is from July 2013 - June 2014. It is expected that the whole season data can give more clarity of and trend compare if only analysing on certain seasons. Additionally, one year data is already taken approximately 1.5GB which already make Tableau struggling. Furthermore, there is limit on number of rows in Tableau, 15 000 000 rows data which is not possible to combine the whole data.

Due to file size, the data will not be uploaded in this github. Only jupyter notebook is included in this repo. The Tableau workbook will be provided through this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmad.makintha.btany/viz/Tableau_HW_5_16278296014970/Story1?publish=yes).

Jupyter Notebook is used to compile the and concatenate the monthly data into one year data as a single file. Tableau is use to vizualize the data.
